1. **Install Laravel** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   composer global require laravel/installer
   ```
   Ensure that the `~/.composer/vendor/bin` directory is in your PATH so the `laravel` executable can be found.

   ```
4. Set up your .env file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. Generate the application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
6. Set up your database configuration in the .env file:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```
7. Run migrations:
   ```bash

8. (Optional) Seed the database with initial data:
