### **Key Features:**
1. **Recipe Creation by Chefs**  
   - Chefs register and create a profile.
   - Once approved, chefs can add recipes by specifying ingredients, preparation steps, images, and an hourly booking rate.
   - Recipes are categorized (e.g., Indian, Arabian, Italian) for easy filtering by users.

3. **AI Custom Recipe Creation (via ChatGPT)**  
   - Users who can't decide can interact with an AI-driven bot.
   - AI asks questions to gather preferences (cuisine type, ingredients, dietary needs, cooking time, etc.).
   - Based on these inputs, the AI (Master Chef role) generates a customized recipe.
   - Users can download the AI-generated recipe as a PDF or book the **Master Chef (AI)** to assist.

4. **Booking System and Payment**  
   - Once a recipe or custom AI recipe is selected, users can choose to book a chef.

   - Users have a personal dashboard where they can manage their profile, view order history, check upcoming bookings, and save favorite recipes.

### **Explanation of the Workflow:**

#### **1. User Registration/Login**  
Users can register using either email (with OTP verification) or social logins (Google, Facebook). Upon login, they have access to their personal dashboard.

#### **2. Recipe Creation by Chefs**  
Chefs, once approved, can add their expertise recipes to the platform, setting an hourly rate. Each recipe has a detailed description, image, ingredients, and cooking steps.

#### **3. AI Custom Recipe Generation**  
If a user is indecisive, they can interact with an AI-powered recipe creation system. The AI (acting as a **Master Chef**) gathers user preferences and generates a custom recipe. This recipe can then be downloaded or booked for a real-time chef appointment.

#### **4. Recipe Search & Interaction**  
Users can search for recipes through categories, filters, or simply by browsing popular dishes. Once they select a recipe, they can download it as a PDF or book a chef to help them cook in person.

#### **5. Appointment Booking & Payment**  
For both AI-generated recipes and chef-created recipes, users can book a chef for a cooking appointment. This includes filling out a form with the necessary details and proceeding to payment.

#### **6. Admin Panel**  
The admin manages the entire system, including users, chefs, recipes, and custom AI recipes. They can approve or block users and chefs and handle any system disputes.

#### **7. Feedback System**  
After the appointment, users can leave feedback and rate their experience, improving the platformâ€™s quality and credibility.

#### **8. Social Features & Live Chat**  
The platform includes **social login** options and live support via a third-party bot API to assist users with any issues in real-time.
